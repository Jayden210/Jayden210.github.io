### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4 was one of my favorite labs because it was a good way to help us learn how to use functions in our code. It was one of the first times that we were incorporating functions from a different file from our code and it helped me to understand how they work. I also really liked working on the hi/lo game in part 2.


* Lab 8

    Lab 8 was really fun to work on because it had a lot of elements from previous labs that I liked. Calculating the average of Olympic scores in part 1 by using different functions was really fun. The challenge of trying to figure out how to create the pattern in part 2 was also really intriguing.


* Lab 12

     Lab 12 was one of my favorites because it introduced a new topic that was unlike anything else that we worked on before. Creating gifs using code was really cool because it was something that I have always wondered about but never knew how it worked. I also like how the lab incorporated a lot of different things that we learned in our previous labs.
